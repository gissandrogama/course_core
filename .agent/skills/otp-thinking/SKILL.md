# OTP Thinking

**Resumo (pt-BR):** GenServer é gargalo por design (um processo, uma mensagem por vez). Use ETS para leituras paralelas. Task.Supervisor em produção, não Task.async. Broadway = filas externas; Oban = jobs em DB.

Paradigm shifts for OTP design. These insights challenge typical concurrency and state management patterns.

## The Iron Law

```
GENSERVER IS A BOTTLENECK BY DESIGN
```

A GenServer processes ONE message at a time. Before creating one, ask: Do I need serialized access? Will this become a throughput bottleneck? Can reads bypass the GenServer via ETS?

**The ETS pattern:** GenServer owns ETS table; writes serialize through GenServer; reads bypass with `:read_concurrency`. Don't wrap stateless functions in GenServer.

## GenServer Patterns

- `call/3`: synchronous, expecting reply; use for back-pressure with appropriate timeouts
- `cast/2`: fire-and-forget
- `handle_continue/2`: post-init work—keeps `init/1` fast and non-blocking

## Task.Supervisor, Not Task.async

| Pattern | On task crash |
|---------|----------------|
| Task.async/1 | Caller crashes (linked) |
| Task.Supervisor.async_nolink/2 | Caller survives |

Use Task.Supervisor for production, graceful shutdown, observability. Use Task.async only for experiments or when crash-together is acceptable.

## DynamicSupervisor + Registry

Use Registry for names—never create atoms dynamically. `via_tuple(id) = {:via, Registry, {MyApp.Registry, id}}`. PartitionSupervisor scales for many children.

## :pg vs Registry

- **Registry:** Single node, named dynamic processes
- **:pg:** Cluster-wide process groups, pub/sub (:pg replaced :pg2)

## Broadway vs Oban

| Tool | Use For |
|------|---------|
| Broadway | External queues (SQS, Kafka, RabbitMQ)—data ingestion with batching |
| Oban | Background jobs with database persistence |

Broadway is NOT a job queue. Don't use Broadway for background jobs; don't use Oban for external queue consumption.

## Supervision Strategies

- :one_for_one: independent children
- :one_for_all: interdependent (all restart)
- :rest_for_one: sequential dependency

Set :max_restarts and :max_seconds to prevent restart loops.

## Abstraction Decision Tree

Need state? No → plain function. Yes → Complex? No → Agent. Yes → Supervision? No → spawn_link. Yes → Request/response? No → Task.Supervisor. Yes → Explicit states? No → GenServer. Yes → GenStateMachine.

## Storage

- Memory cache: ETS (`:read_concurrency`)
- Static config: :persistent_term
- Disk (small): DETS (2GB limit)
- Transactions/distribution: Mnesia

## Red Flags - STOP and Reconsider

- GenServer wrapping stateless computation
- Task.async in production when you need error handling
- Creating atoms dynamically for process names
- Single GenServer as throughput bottleneck
- Using Broadway for background jobs (use Oban)
- Using Oban for external queue consumption (use Broadway)
